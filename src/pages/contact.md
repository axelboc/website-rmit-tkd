      It sure is! We welcome any level of fitness and skills â€“ no judgment, no
      pressure.
    question: I'm a complete beginner. Is it okay?
  - answer: >-
      You can purchase your membership online, on the club's <a
      href="https://rmitlink.rmit.edu.au/Clubs/taekwondoitf">RMIT Link page</a>.

    question: How do I purchase the membership?
  - answer: >-
      We always start with a good warm-up and finish with stretching. The rest
      is usually a mix of fitness and strength training, and practice of
      techniques, patterns, sparring drills and self-defence.
    question: What exactly do you do at training?
  - answer: >-
      Just come in gym clothes and bring a water bottle. That's all you need to
      get started! You will need a dobok eventually, but there's no rush. Discuss
      it with us at training once you become a member.
    question: What should I bring?
  - answer: >-
      Class times are displayed on the <a href="/">homepage</a>. For your first
      class, please come in 15 minutes in advance to introduce yourself and get
      changed.
    question: What time do classes start?
  - answer: >-
      All members (inc. non-RMIT) are covered by RMIT's insurance. You are also
      covered during your first three free classes.
    question: What happens if I get injured during class?
