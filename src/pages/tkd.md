Taekwon-Do is a version of unarmed combat designed for the purpose of self-defence. It was founded in the 1950s by Choi Hong Hi (1918-2002), a South Korean General and Ambassador.

Taekwon-Do martial artists employ both hand and foot techniques, which combine the notions of reaction force, concentration, balance, breath control and speed in order to achieve maximum power.

One of the many appeals of ITF Taekwon-Do is the diversity of events that take place during competitions. There is sparring of course, but also patterns, team sparring, team patterns, self-defence, power breaking and special techniques.

Ultimately, it's an excellent tool for both physical and mental development. But don't take our word for it... Come and try it out!
