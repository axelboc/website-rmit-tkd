Taekwon-Do is a martial art designed for the purpose of self-defence. It was founded in Korean in the 1950s.

Taekwon-Do martial artists employ both hand and foot techniques that are designed to achieve maximum power on the basis of scientific principles. It's an excellent tool for both physical and mental development.
