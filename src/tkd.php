					<p>Taekwon-Do is a version of unarmed combat designed for the purpose of <strong>self-defence</strong>. It was founded in the 1950s by <strong>Choi Hong Hi</strong> (1918-2002), a South Korean General and Ambassador. Our club is part of the Chan Hun International Taekwon-Do Federation (<strong><a class="link-blend" href="http://www.chitf.org/" target="_blank">CHITF</a></strong>), which was founded by Grand Master Phap Lu.</p>
					<p>Taekwon-Do martial artists employ both <strong>hand</strong> and <strong>foot techniques</strong>. Supported by modern scientific evidence, these techniques combine the notions of reaction force, concentration, balance, breath control and speed in order to achieve maximum power.</p>
					<p>One of the many appeals of ITF Taekwon-Do is the diversity of events that take place during competitions. There is sparring of course, but also patterns, team sparring, team patterns, self-defence, power breaking and special techniques.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, it's an excellent tool for both <strong>physical</strong> and <strong>mental development</strong>. But don't take our word for it... Come and try it out!</p>

							<p>The RMIT ITF Taekwon-Do Club is affiliated to <a class="link-blend" href="http://www.laitkd.com.au/" target="_blank">Lai Taekwon-Do</a>, under the guidance of <strong>Grand Master Robert Lai</strong> (9th degree) and his son Jason Lai (6th degree).</p>
							<p>Grand Master Lai was born in Malaysia. He started Taekwon-Do in 1964 <strong>at the age of 19</strong>, after watching a demonstration by General Choi and his squad. The training hall was a small Buddhist temple so numbers were limited, and Grand Master Lai was one of 30 students chosen to begin training.</p>
							<p>Grand Master Lai achieved his black belt in 1966 and <strong>represented Malaysia</strong> in the early international tournaments of 1967, 1968 and 1971. In the following years, he decided to focus on instructing, and built up many clubs around Malaysia. He then moved to Australia in the 1980s. He eventually became a <strong><abbr title="Physical Education">PE</abbr> teacher</strong> at St Albans Secondary College, where he founded <em>Lai Taekwon-Do</em>.</p>
